## What is it about ?

	Basically, this is my portfolio website, where I constantly upload
	everything I create there. Feel free to play with them and/or view/copy
	their source code.

	The webpages/websites in this repository contains:

		- My Own designs (but since I am too creative, I don't do my own designs that much).
		- Some Cloned websites for practicing.
	
### So, Why I am putting everything here ?
	
	Well, It's easy for me to just clone everything from github to my own server than SSHing or using FTP.
	However, Once I start getting serious, I won't be doing that...
